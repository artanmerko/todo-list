# todo-list
## JavaScript PROJECT: Todo-list
### About 
 *JavaScript Todo List helps you create a list of things you want to do throughout the day ,week or year. Suppose you want to do something throughout the day that you can list here. Whenever you complete that task then you can delete it.*
 ### Assignment
1. Your ‘todos’ are going to be objects that you’ll want to dynamically create, which means either using factories or constructors/classes to generate them.
2. Brainstorm what kind of properties your todo-items are going to have. At a minimum they should have a title, description, dueDate and priority. You might also want to include notes or even a checklist.
3. Your todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos. When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of ‘default’ project to which all of their todos are put. Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.
